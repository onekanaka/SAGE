# Simple ASCII Game Engine
Small project made for educational purposes to show how to use some modern C++ features like std::vector, std::chrono, and language characteristics like loops, inheritance, references and pointers, etc.

The idea was to present, as simple and easy to read as possible, concepts like how the game loop works, together with the framerate and the delta time, using a Component pattern similar to Unity and Unreal to be able render and interact with elements.

For simplicity, we used the Windows console for all input and output, so no third-party libraries were used, including OpenGL or DirectX.

Any C++ compiler that supports C++11 and onwards should be enough to make this run, like g++. The resulting executable has a Pong clone out of the box as example.

The code is completely free for anybody to use and study from, under the WTFPL.
